# Assignment1 - Hello World

## In this assignment you will:

* [Get Your Flutter Build Environment Setup](#get-your-flutter-build-environment-setup)
* [Create your first app](#create-your-first-app)
* [Create your first APK (Android Install Package)](#getting-graded)

> Note: Flutter supports development for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web; however, I will only be requiring Android and web results in this class (iOS development requires having an Apple computer).


For this first assignment you are getting grade on if you succeed in turning in an Android APK that launches and successfully displays "CINS467 Hello World". This assignment is mostly to make sure you have the build environment setup and can successfully create and export an Android App for grading/install onto phones/devices.

## Get Your Flutter Build Environment Setup

To get the build environment on your computer you should go to the [Flutter Install](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install) page and follow the directions there for your operating system.

Make sure you:
* Confirm your system requirements meet the minimum requirements
* Get the Flutter SDK
* Update your path
* Run `flutter doctor`
  * I recommend running this command with the -v tag for verbose output

After you run `flutter doctor -v`, you should see a report displayed to the terminal. Check the output carefully for other software you might need to install or further tasks to perform. The instructions provided in this report should address the other tasks that need to be completed; alternatively, you can go back to the installation instructions in the documentation and complete the following.

Make sure you:
* Can develop for Android
  * You may use your own Android device or the Android emulator (or both)
  * If you want to use the Android emulator: Download and install Android Studio (this is the easiest way I know of to work with the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager)
* Can develop for web (this should be setup by default)

Ideally, you will be able to run `flutter doctor -v` and have the report say, "No issues found!" However, remember that XCode (iOS and macOS) is NOT required for this class, so it is ok if there are "issues" there.

### Code Editing

I recommend you develop using the [VS Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode) editor with Flutter and Dart plugins, as this is how I'll be developing during class. [Android Studio](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio), which includes the IntelliJ IDE, Android SDK Tools, and Android Emulator all together, is also a good option for development. For Android Studio, you'll also need to add the plugins for Flutter/Dart as directed in that getting started with Android Studio for Flutter link. It is easier for me to demo the code on the projector with VS Code, but both are equally good. I do recommend relying on the Flutter command line directly for building your flutter exports, as it is more consistent than the built-in plugins for generating your submissions.

### flutter doctor

Remember to use `flutter doctor -v` to make sure your setup is configured correctly. An example of flutter doctor running successfully on my computer is as follows:

```bash
~/$ flutter doctor -v                                              î‚² âœ”

## Create Your First App

**Disclaimer:** *You should go through the steps yourself to create the Hello World app and not just import an existing Hello World app as you'll miss out on going through the steps of creating a new app.*

### Requirements:

* Your app should display "CINS467 Hello World"

### Walk-through

So to start create a "New Flutter Project", which you could do via the VScode or Android studio plugins; however, I would do it in the commandline where you want to host your project code. I would run this in the folder where the repo you'll be submitting to is cloned.

```bash
~/repos/CINS467-repo/$ flutter create AssignmentProject
```

You can name your project whatever you wish, and can use the same project for all of the assignment submissions. I opted to name it *AssignmentProject* for my example.

From here edit your main.dart to have a Text widget that says "CINS467 Hello World". The following would work; however, for the *home* component of *MaterialApp* I would **highly recommend** you wrap the Text widget in a *Scaffold/Column* so that the Text widget is centered and easier to see with your required text.

```Dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Hello World App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Text("Hello World"),
    );
  }
}

```
## Getting Graded

> APK stands for Android Package Kit - it is the file format that Android uses to distribute and install apps.

You will need to run the `flutter build apk` command to create a new APK. The command should overwrite any files that are currently in the `build/` directory; however, if you want to be sure you are creating a fresh APK, you can remove the build folder using either `flutter clean` or `rm` (you should not need to run both commands):

```bash
~/repos/CINS467-repo/AssignmentProject$ flutter clean
~/repos/CINS467-repo/AssignmentProject$ rm -rf build
```

Then explicitly build a new APK:

```bash
~/repos/CINS467-repo/AssignmentProject$ flutter build apk
```

Look for the `app-release.apk` file - it should be located in the build folder path here: `build/app/outputs/apk/release/`. Once you find this .apk file, copy or move it to the root directory of your GIT repo that you created to turn in assignments for this class.

If you don't have a CINS467 GitHub repo, go use the Generate GitHub Repo form on www.bryancdixon.com to request one.

You will submit all the assignments for this class to separate branches. You can keep building on the same app for the future submissions as well, just adding the required new features to it, or you can build separate apps in the same directory.

```
    /
    ...app-release.apk
    ...AssignmentProject/
    ......android/
    ......ios/
    ......web/
    ......lib/
    ......pubspec.yaml
    ......(Rest of App Files)
```

Now submit your code to the **assignment1** branch:

```
git checkout -b assignment1 #create branch and switch to it
git add -A #add all
git commit -m "Assignment 1 Submission" #Commit changes to branch
git push --set-upstream origin assignment1 #Push code up to assignment1 branch on remote
```

Make sure your branch is exactly named `assignment1` matching the case, spacing, etc as my grading script will only pull your submission if it matches exactly.
