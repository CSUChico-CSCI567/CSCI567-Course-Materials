#Assignment 3 - Simple Event Receiver

##In this assignment your app needs to do the following:

* Receive an event, which can be easily caused during grading.
* Throw a notification on the Event
* Indicate in the app activity/UI what Event your app throws a notification on


As long as your app does those tasks you will get credit for this assignment.

##Getting Graded

When you have your APK move it to a "Submissions" folder in the root directory of your GIT repo that you were given to turn in assignments for this class. You'll be putting all of the APK files for this class in this folder. The source code should be in a directory named the same as your app in the root directory. I recommend creating your projects in the git repo. Do not use Android Studio to manage your VCS/Repo as it may screw up the repo. So for this assignment you should have a directory that looks like the following:

<pre>
    /
    ...Submissions/
    ......eventreceiver_<your name>.apk
    ...EventReceiver/
    ......app/
    ......(Rest of EventReceiver App Files)
</pre>

You should also name your project Event Receiver \<Your Name\>, replacing \<Your Name\> with your actual name.
