#Assignment 5 - Simple DB App

##In this assignment your app needs to do the following:

* Have a simple UI
	* TextView
    * EditText
    * Button to Get Text
    * Button to Add Text
* Put text into DB
	* Need to insure duplicate text won't be added
* Read contents of a DB


Your UI should allow us via the EditText to add new text to the database, but prevent duplicate entries in the database. And then with the "Get Text" button read out the text from the database into the textview.

##Getting Graded

When you have your APK move it to a "Submissions" folder in the root directory of your GIT repo that you were given to turn in assignments for this class. You'll be putting all of the APK files for this class in this folder. The source code should be in a directory named the same as your app in the root directory. I recommend creating your projects in the git repo. Do not use Android Studio to manage your VCS/Repo as it may screw up the repo. So for this assignment you should have a directory that looks like the following:

<pre>
    /
    ...Submissions/
    ......simpledb_<your name>.apk
    ...SimpleDB/
    ......app/
    ......(Rest of SimpleDB App Files)
</pre>

 You should also name your project Simple DB \<Your Name\>, replacing \<Your Name\> with your actual name.
