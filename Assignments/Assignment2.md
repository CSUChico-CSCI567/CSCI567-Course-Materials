# Assignment 2 - Web Hello World

## In this assignment your app needs to do the following:

* Be hosted as a github pages
* Your app should display "CINS467 Hello World"

As long as your app does those tasks you will get credit for this assignment.

## Getting Graded

When you have your project finished submit it in the following format

```
    /
    ...web.md
    ...Assignment2/
    ......android/
    ......ios/
    ......lib/
    ......pubspec.yaml
    ......(Rest of firebase App Files)
```
In your web.md file you should have a web URL for your assignment hosted online. You can do a web hosted submission for all the subsequent assignments as long as they continue to do the functionality of the earlier assignments. So the **web.md** file will remain the same for all these submissions. You also can continue to use the same project code as long as it is submitted to the correct branch. 

### Now submit your code to the **assignment3** branch:

```
git checkout -b assignment2 #create branch and switch to it
git add -A #add all
git commit -m "Assignment 2 Submission" #Commit changes to branch
git push --set-upstream origin assignment2 #Push code up to assignment2 branch on remote
```

Make sure your branch is exactly named **assignment2** matching the case, spacing, etc as my grading script will only pull your submission if it matches exactly.
