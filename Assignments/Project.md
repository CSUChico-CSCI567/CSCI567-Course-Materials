This project will occupy most of your time this semester. The early assignments and lectures will hopefully give you the rudimentary tools you need to get started creating a Flutter Application for this project.

## <a name="overview">Final Project Overview</a>

The primary purpose of this project is to give you the opportunity to create a working Flutter Application. An additional goal is to give you a reason to make use of some of the software development tools discussed in this course (GIT, Issue Tracking, CI/CD, testing, etc). There are a few different classifications of projects (which will be discussed in a later section) -- this will hopefully provide you with flexibility and freedom to pursue something you or your partner has an interest in, whether it be a new app idea or contributing to an open source project. I am hopeful that you all will find this project fun and exciting, and I look forward to seeing your results at the end of this semester!

If you need web and/or database backends for your project, I have Google Cloud credits available for every student that can go towards hosting on Google's Cloud services; however, the free tier for most of their services should be plenty for the scope of projects you are doing. Once I have approved your project, I will include the sign up link for Google Cloud Credits in my response to the team.

I highly recommend you work with Firebase on their free tier as the backend for your projects. The generous [No-cost Spark Plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) provides enough features to meet most students' needs for their final projects.

## <a name="options">Final Project Options</a>

For this project there are two different options for the type of project you can pursue. If you have general questions about either of these project options please ask. Remember that in any case, your project needs to both:
* Leverage the fact it is on a device with internet connectivity
  * You must send and/or receive data from an internet-based source such as the Firebase database (Cloud Firestore) or an API.
* Use the camera and/or location services on the device
  * If you are planning on using the camera, remember that the gallery or the ability to access files is not the same as using the camera.

* **New Project**
  * With this option, you will create and work on a project you/your partner come up with. If working with a partner, you will want to make sure you both are doing enough for it to be a good project, while at the same time making sure you are not trying to do too much. This is where the project proposal will be extremely important and helpful.
  * If you choose this option, you should try to get me your project proposal before it is due so I can work with you to ensure the project has a good scope of work.


* **Open Source Project**
  * This option would require you to find an existing open source project that you/your partner will contribute to. Your project proposal will need to make sure that it indicates what contributions you will be making. For this project, you will also want to clone the open source project into a private repo for your group to use for the CINS 467 Final Project. You may push your revisions up to the original open source project after the semester.
  * If you choose this option, you should figure out how and what you will be contributing to the project early on, so I can make sure your deliverables will actually be a significant contribution to the open source project. You will need to contribute significantly to the open source project to be successful on this kind of project.


Once you've decided on which kind of project you will be doing you should begin brainstorming what you expect to get done this semester and then move onto putting together the project Concept and Proposal submissions.


## <a name="idea">Final Project Concept</a>

The goal of the **Final Project Concept** submission is for you to provide a description that gives a basic idea for your project. You should get your Concept approved before completing the Full Proposal. Your final Project Concept submission should include the initial parts of the proposal:

* **Project Title**
  * Your project proposal should be titled with what you expect to call your app.
* **Project Members**
  * You should make sure that you identify all members of the project team right below the project title.
  * I recommend you work in a group of 2 for the project, but individual projects and groups of 3 could also be approved depending on the concept and proposal.
* **Project Description**
  * This should describe what your project is and what you expect it to accomplish. This description has some similarities to an elevator pitch -- it should explain the concept of your project in a way that any listener could understand it in a short period of time (explain who it is for and what it offers).
  * This should include an overview of what you expect to accomplish. Make sure to highlight how you expect your app to use internet connectivity along with either location services or the camera.


If you are completing the project as a team, the quality and complexity of the project proposed should be slightly higher than that of an individual project; however, it does not have to be twice as complex, since working successfully as a team provides its own challenges.


Submit the **Final Project Concept** to Canvas as a **PDF** document. If you are working as a team, you have two options:
* One member of the team submits the PDF document to Canvas, while all other team members submit a text entry that says who is on the team and who submitted the PDF.
* All members of the team submit the exact same PDF document to Canvas.
* Either way, make sure your team has communicated how the Final Project Concept will be submitted.


## <a name="proposal">Final Project Full Proposal</a>

Your **Final Project Full Proposal** must contain the Final Project Concept (what your project is, who is working on the project, a general idea of what you will accomplish by the end of the semester), as well as some additional components (described below). The Project Title, Project Members, and Project Description should match or be similar to the *Final Project Concept* that you previously submitted -- if your concept got feedback that required any changes, you can address the feedback in your Final Project Full Proposal submission. As such, your Final Project Full Proposal should have the following sections:

* **Project Title**
  * Your project proposal should be titled with what you expect to call your app.
* **Project Members**
  * You should make sure that you identify all members of the project team right below the project title.
* **Project Description**
  * Use what you submitted for Final Project Concept, with any changes as needed.
  * You should also indicate if you are building for Android or Web at this point. You are not required to do both but you are welcome to target more than one platform. If you want to target iOS or desktop, you must also build for either Android or Web.
* **Project UIs**
  * This is a section of the document where you briefly describe or show prototype sketches/diagrams of what the expected UI for your app will look like at the end of the semester. This should include all of the Views/Widgets you plan on creating. This component of the proposal is similar to a website wireframe, a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.
  * It is fine if your views (the number of views or what is displayed in the views) is different at the end of the semester. As you develop your project, you may realize that something else will work better. You do not need to resubmit your proposal if the updates do not significantly change the overall idea of your project.
  * Your Project UIs may be hand drawn or completed with a wireframing tool of your choice. It is ok if this component does not look professional, but I expect you to have given some thought to how people will interact with your site (page layout, interface elements, navigation).
* **Diagram Screen Relationships**
  * Taking the UI design/interaction process a bit farther, this section should show in a transition graph how the different screens relate to each other and transitions from one activity to another. How does everything work together?
  * Completing this section should help you design the UI in the previous stage. To be effective, each state in the diagram should connect to a specific UI from the previous section.
* **Project Deliverables**
  * This is the most important section of the proposal -- this is where you will actually create a list of expected contributions, features, developments, etc that you expect to have working by the end of the semester.
  * As your proposal will contribute to your project grade, more detail vs less detail here is important.
  * You should ideally have expected deliverables and bonus deliverables in separate **lists**. You will get graded on if you get your expected deliverables completed and will get bonus points for going beyond that.
  * These deliverables need to be clearly stated so that when I read the proposal, it is clear to me what you are going to be doing for the project. If this is not clear, you will need to further explain your project deliverables to me before I will sign off on your project. You will lose points off your proposal significantly if I need to do this.
  * If I feel your project isn't significant enough, I will ask you to complete more of your deliverables or add more to the project. Alternatively, if I feel that your project is taking on too much, I will propose a subset of your deliverables that you should make sure to get working first. The fact that you may need to modify the scope of your project proposal is the reason why I want you to start thinking about and submit your proposal as early as possible. Remember that I will need time to adequately read through and think about your projects.
* **Project Organization and Timeline**
  * This section breaks down how you expect to organize and manage the development of the project among your team. What is the general plan? Are different members going to be assigned different components? Figure out what everyone's job/tasks will be, so everyone knows what they are doing when they start working on the project.
  * Think through the responsibilities for each team member at this stage. Depending on your project and the size of your team, it would potentially be worthwhile to have someone focus on test completeness/soundness for all the functionality of your app. This would be very useful for tying your project into a CI/CD framework. CI/CD will be discussed in class and is an important component of most real world applications.
  * **You must create a timeline for every member of the team.**
    * Everyone's timeline may be a little different, but you might include steps for getting aspects of your project set up, working, developed, etc.
    * For each individual team member, set milestones that you want to complete by a given time (be realistic about the time you think you will need, but it is ok if you do not follow your timeline exactly)
    * Make sure to include time to test each component and confirm that everything is working as expected.
    * You must set at least 5 milestones per developer (you can create more milestones, too, if you think it makes sense). This equals out to about 1 milestone per week -- aim to make progress on your final project EVERY week for the last portion of the semester. Remember that you will need to regularly submit project progress updates. Do NOT leave everything until the last week or so!


You will need to write this and submit it as a **PDF** document to me via email with the subject line *CINS467 Project Proposal* with all of your team members CC'd. If you want faster feedback you can email your project proposal to me, before the submission deadline. Submitting it significantly before the deadline, will allow me to give you feedback without any grade penalty.

Submit the **Final Project Full Proposal** to Canvas as a **PDF** document. If you are working as a team, you have two options:
* One member of the team submits the PDF document to Canvas, while all other team members submit a text entry that says who is on the team and who submitted the PDF.
* All members of the team submit the exact same PDF document to Canvas.
* Either way, make sure your team has communicated how the Final Project Full Proposal will be submitted.

## <a name="submission">Final Project Submission</a>

I will create a private repo on GitHub and/or GitLab for your project -- the repo will be named with the title of your project, and all group members will have access to the repo. You should use this repo for development of your project. This is where I will look for your project submission on the due date. For the final submission, make sure you put the compiled APK file into the root path of your git repo so I can easily install and test your project. If you have an iOS version of your project, I will not be testing it.

Failure to use the repo for code collaboration will not result in any direct grading impact; however, if there is a group work dispute I will use the commit history to gain insight into who contributed what. One of the key reasons for having you work in teams for this project is to provide you the opportunity to collaborate on a project with version control -- a necessary skill when you enter the workforce. I also hope you will leverage CI/CD & testing in your projects, and GitHub and GitLab are a great resource in that regard.  

## <a name="presentation">Final Project Presentation</a>

The project presentations will be 10 minute presentations by each group. I recommend that you show your app to the class and walk through how it works. You do not need to have a slide show, but you may include one if you think it would be helpful.

You should also plan on discussing the following:

* Overview of what your project/app is
* Technical hurdles you ran into
* What you still have to get working
* What you found cool/exciting about your project


## <a name="grading">Final Project Grading</a>

Your grading for the Project will break down into the following components:

* Project Proposal
	- This will be worth about 10% of the overall project grade. The grades for this component will be determined both by how clear the details in the proposal are presented and the amount of thought/detail included (deliverables, group organization, etc). I am really looking for clearly organized details and an indication that you have thought out every component thoroughly.

* Project Presentation
	- This will be worth about 10% of the overall project grade. Your grade on this will be determined by whether or not you give a presentation. I will also look to see that the presentation gives a clear understanding of what your project is, how it works, and technical hurdles you tackled to get it working.

* Project Midpoint Evaluation - Project Progress Updates
  - These will be worth about 10% of the overall project grade. After you have submitted all other assignments and the project proposal, there will be some time set aside for lab help sessions. You are expected to make progress on your project every week, and this will be a way for you to show me that you are making progress.
  - We will accomplish this either via class lab time, where I will check in with each group during a class period or each group will demo where their project is partway through the semester.

* Lecture and Lab Help Session Attendance, Presentation Feedback Forms
  - These will together be worth about 10% of the overall project grade. You will need to fill out feedback forms for at least 80% of the presentations and attend at least 80% of lectures and lab help sessions to receive full credit for this portion of the grade.


* Final Project
  * This will be worth about 60% of the overall project grade.
  * Your grade for this comes from the following:
    * Meeting deliverables: This is why it is important that you make sure to have a good grasp on what your project is and what you expect to be able to turn in at the end of the semester. The more detail you include in your deliverables, the more I will be able to see that you met your deliverables. I will also weight the difficulty of your deliverables, based on your survey at the end of the semester, my experience with aspects of your app, and the difficulty of your app overall. I try to ensure you expand your deliverables during the proposal stage; however, I have had students turn in such rudimentary projects at the end that I had to lower the weight of their end product.  
    * Quality of App: I will use your app to test the deliverables. How easy it is to use your app as well as how it looks will play into this aspect of your grade. This is one reason you should make sure to spend some significant time planning your UIs for the proposal -- not only will it give you a clearer picture of what you want your app to look like, but it will also improve this aspect of your app overall. Additionally, you need to focus on how you can use Material Design's guidelines, components, and tools to ensure your app is usable and well designed.
    * Crashes: If your app force-closes during execution, I will not be able to give full credit for your app even if it is otherwise amazing.
    * Fails to work:
    	* Android: I will likely be testing your apps on a Google Pixel 5. Student code that fails to install or work correctly on Android 11 will potentially lose points here.
    	* Web: if your project is not hosted at the URL you provide for the project, I will follow up; however, failure to resolve hosting within 24 hours will lose points here.
    	* Both: If I can not get the code to run or should your provided deliverable not work, you will need to meet with me to demo your project. If you fail to do this, I will have to go off of what was presented. If you failed to present as well, you will not get any of the final project submission credit.  
    * Your Contribution
      * If you did not contribute your portion of the overall app development, you will lost credit for your project grade. This will come from team evaluations and analysis of your physical code contributions on GitHub and/or GitLab.


## <a name="feedback">Final Project and Group Feedback</a>

At the end of the semester, you will be given a Google form link -- in this form, you will be required to give feedback on your experience in the course and with the project. If you worked in a group, you will also be asked to evaluate how well the group worked together and how much you felt each teammate contributed. This includes expanding on why some deliverables did not get completed and what was learned in trying to get them to work. Failure to do this survey will result in the loss of the group evaluation credit and potentially loss of the final project grade.
